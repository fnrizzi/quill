/**
 * A singe-producer single-consumer FIFO circular buffer
 *
 * The buffer allows producing and consuming objects
 * The object type has to be provided as a template parameter
 *
 * Production is wait free. When the internal circlular buffer becomes full
 * a new one will be created and the production will continue in the new buffer.
 *
 * Consumption is wait free. If not data is available a special value is returned. If a new
 * buffer is created from the producer the consumer first consumes everything in the old
 * buffer and then moves to the new buffer.
 *
 * The old buffer is not used anymore when it becomes empty once.
 *
 * A grow factor of 1.5 is used.
 *
 * @note This class has a slight performance penalty compared to the fixed_circular_buffer
 *       version but it offers extra safety. When performance is important consider using a
 *       large fixed_circular_buffer instead.
